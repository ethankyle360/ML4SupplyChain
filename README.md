# Machine Learning for Supply Chain

Welcome to the ML4SupplyChain repository, where we explore and develop machine-learning solutions to optimize and innovate in the field of supply chain management.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that address various challenges within the supply chain sector. Each project aims to leverage data-driven insights to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the overall effectiveness of supply chain operations.

## Projects

Here is a brief overview of some of the key projects included in this repository:

- **Demand Forecasting**: Utilizes historical sales data to predict future product demand, helping ensure optimal stock levels.
- **Inventory Optimization**: Implements algorithms to minimize overstock and understock situations, reducing holding costs and maximizing availability.
- **Route Optimization**: Applies advanced routing algorithms to improve delivery efficiency and reduce transportation costs.
- **Supplier Selection Model**: Uses predictive analytics to evaluate and select the best suppliers based on performance metrics such as reliability, cost, and quality.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical processing.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For more advanced machine learning models like deep learning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
